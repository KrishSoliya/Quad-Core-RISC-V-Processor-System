# Quad-Core-RISC-V-Processor-System
The primary objective of this project was to design a multi-core system that shares a single unified Data RAM. To manage simultaneous memory access requests from four independent cores, a Round-Robin Arbiter was implemented. This ensures fair, starvation-free access for all cores, preventing data corruption and bus contention.
